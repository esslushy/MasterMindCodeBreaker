# MasterMindCodeBreaker
A Python program that tries to solve a 4,7 mastermind game in the least guesses possible. It won't be 100% accurate, but it will fast.

# Purpose
This challenge was given to me via discord by Etetherin. This is a return for his favor of making art for me. I also wanted to do this challenge because I wanted to practice with python and decision trees as well as learn how to make a bot that operates on a site. The site that is used is www.wafas.com which is the one that has the game.
