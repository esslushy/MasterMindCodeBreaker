A Python program that tries to solve a 4,6 mastermind game in the least guesses possible. It's goal is to be as fast and as consisten as possible.
# Used:
- Selenium for web interaction
- https://github.com/Dungyichao/Mastermind Assistance for mastermind solving code. Modified to work with repeats in code.
# Purpose
This challenge was given to me via discord by Etetherin. This is a return for his favor of making art for me. I also wanted to do this challenge because I wanted to practice with python and decision trees as well as learn how to make a bot that operates on a site.
